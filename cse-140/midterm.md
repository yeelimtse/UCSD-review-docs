# **Components and Design Techniques for Digital Systems**

---
### **Intro**
- Integrated Circuit
  - def: *many digital operations on the same material*
  - complex circuits: **8 billions transitors**

- **Moore's Law**
  - transistor counts double every **2** years 
    - **wider** applications
    - **larger** market
    - **higher** revenue
    - **more** R & D


---
## **Combinational Logic (Midterm 1)**
- **binary** inputs
- no memory
- ### Basic CMOS - inverter
  - transistors as switches TODO
---
## **Sequential Nerworks (Midterm 2)**
- **memory** + **time steps (Clock)**
---
## **Data Path Subsystem (Final)**
---
## **Control Subsystem (Final)**
