# **What is DNS**
DNS stands for `Domain Name System`.
- Communication between computers
- resolve names to numbers
- resolves domain names to IP addresses
- Call a website, DNS will search its database and return a matching IP address.
- Basically works like a phone book.
- Process
  - Let's say we are quirying `google.com`, it will search it's cache to see if we have ever visited this website before. If yes, then we have it's IP stored in our local browser cache.
