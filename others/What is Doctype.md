# **What is Doctype in HTML**
- A document type declaration, so that the browser knows how to read your code.
- Based on **MDN web docs**
  - In HTML, the doctype is the required preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called "quirks mode" when rendering a document.
- **Tells the browser what kind of document to expect**
