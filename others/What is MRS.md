# **What is MRS**
- MRS stands for **Marginal Rate of Substitution**
- Definition
  - How many units of good x have to be given up in order to gain an **extra** unit of good y while keeping the same level of utility
  - The equation is **MRS<sub>xy</sub> = -dy/dx = MU<sub>x</sub>/MU<sub>y</sub>**
- Example 1
  - U = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>
  - U<sub>x</sub>' = 2x > 0
  - U<sub>y</sub>' = 2y > 0
  - So |MRS| = 2x/2y = x/y
- Example 2
  - U = xy
  - U<sub>x</sub>' = y
  - U<sub>y</sub>' = x
  - So |MRS| = y/x
- Some edge cases
  - When both goods are perfect substitutes, the MRS will remain constant
  - When two goods are complementary goods, the indifference curve will be "L" shape
    - In such case, the vertical fragment of each indifference curve has an infinite MRS
    - The horizontal fragment has a MRS of 0
    - As a result, an increase in the consumers utility will only come when the addition of one unit of one good comes along with the same increase of the other good
- Sum up
  - The MRS measures the trade-offs goods when analyzing utility
