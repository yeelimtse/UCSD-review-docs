# UCSD-review-docs
## **What is this?**
This repository includes notes of all of UCSD courses we have taken so far. These notes/review docs are mostly based on course content, piazza questions, past exams, and homeworks, and a little bit further related knowledge in ['other' folder](https://github.com/yeelimtse/UCSD-review-docs/tree/master/others).

## **Is it helpful?**
We have been working on review docs since day one in UCSD and those review materials really help us a lot. Each review doc is carefully summerized and covers every single detail that will possibly be on the test. We all got perfect grades for all of these courses. For example, 4 people in my team who used review doc of Gary's CSE 110 ranked in the first 15 (out of 300 students), 3 of us ranked in the first 20 in Gary's CSE 15L (out of 400), I got 94 out of 100 for Joseph's CSE 30 final, etc. Going through these review docs eliminates the confusion I had and strongers my knowledge fundamental. I hope it will help you get a better grade and learn better.
## **What is the goal?**
I'm a double major in CSE & Management Science, so most review docs are focused on these two subjects, but feel free to contribute any UCSD course you have ever taken with your notes/comments. This repository is an on-going project and we are updating it once a while. We hope the review docs here can cover all UCSD courses in the future and benefit all UCSD students.
## **Notes**
- Some review docs are not properly formatted and we will address that in the future.
- Course contents might be different if the instructors are different, but overall the topics are closely related.
- We do not post any codes, homework solutions or exam solutions. Do not violate UCSD Academic Integrity. 
- Course materials subject to copyright to the original instructor. Shout out to those great educators in UCSD community.
