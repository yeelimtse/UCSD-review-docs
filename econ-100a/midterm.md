- ### Elasticity
  - `E = % ∆y / % ∆x`: between two points
  - `E = ∂f(x) * x / f(x)`: at one specific points
  - Example:
    1. `Q = a - bp` 
       - E<sub>Q,p</sub> = -b * p / (a - bp)

    2. `Q = 7*p`
       - slope = 7, E<sub>Q,p</sub> = 7 * p / (7*p) = **1**
       - constant, always gets the same value
       - functions of the form f(x) = c * x<sup>ß</sup> have **constant** elasticity, `E = ß`

  - If a function has a constant elasticity, then it is a power function
